# Credit_Card_Clustering
1. Applied KMeans, GMM, and Hierarchical Clustering techniques to perform clustering analysis, revealing patterns and structures in the data.
2. Conducted data preprocessing using regression models (RandomForestRegressor, KNN imputer, and Linear Regressor) to handle missing values and prepare the data for clustering.
3. Optimized the number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method, Bayesian Information Criterion, and dendrogram visualization, ensuring optimal cluster identification.
4. Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction and employed Plotly to create 3D scatter plots, enhancing cluster visualization and aiding decision-making processes.
This was a Group project where each member contributed in evry stage of the project.
